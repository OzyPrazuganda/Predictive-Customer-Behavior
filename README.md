# Predictive-Customer-Behavior
in this project, i am doing 2 main task from British Airways company.
### anlysis sentiment
first task is doing a web scraping to gain customer reviews on british airways and use that review to know how many percent the split of positive and negative review towards british airways using sentiment analysis and wordcloud analysis. The result is 55% on positive sentiment, 43% of negative sentiment, and 2% on neutral.
### predictive modelling
using random forest, I predict the customer buying behavior based on dataset that given and gain result that Information about the flight, e.g. flight time and duration was also significant, however booking origin of the customer was not important.
